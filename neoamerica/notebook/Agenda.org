*SCRATCH*
Ok so where do I want to take this. Of course I got this idea from Transmetropolitan/Spider Jerusalem. NeoAmerica "I Think I Hate It Here". I mostly want to make quick burst posts targeting the political world but also pop culture. Due to short attention spans I believe my posts should be short, quick and funny. Colorful to catch attention. Each post should have a colorful meme/image attached to be planted via instagram and lead back to the site. The site its self on the front should be a table format of the images, when clicked on a frame should appear with the actual post...so we're looking at an SPA.
  Now do I want an interface within the website or am I pushing it from my computer and just an editor?

Controversional MICRO NEWS
Should posts come in categories? Just tags?

POST MODEL
id
title
slug
image
content (Do I want to add additional images within my posts? I definitely want to be able to include youtube/embedded videos)
views
category [political, pop culture, tech, misc?]

* IDEA One man twitter show, mixed in with my own items/tshirts/redbubble stuff. also IF YOU'RE AMERICAN COMPANY on Amazon or any platform contact me


* DONE Database model to create posts
* TODO Database transactions. Create, Update, Show All and Single Posts, Delete
* TODO Show posts on front end
* TODO User creation/Authentication/
* TODO Allow sign up/login
* TODO Additional users sign up to comment, share
...
* TODO Forgot password
* TODO Backdoor for myself

* IDEA WHERE YOU FUCKED UP FORMAT. W.Y.F.U Format


# Integrant Study



* WHAT TO DO WITH THIS? FROM JOURNAL

* VIBE
I've been anxious and trying to figure out...business vs personal...neo america or 'saga'...will talking politics run people off? Maybe my vibe should be that of an observer. Thoughtful.

* Thoughts
** TODO check out ghostwheel, debugging tool/specs 
** TODO cockpit view "Mr v3ga, you're now jacked in!"
*** TODO cockpit will be a floating component. When you're logged in it will be available on any view


* [Study]
integrant.repl should be put in user namespace

Reading about integrant now... init-key, is it possible to start with just one component. That defeats the purpose but just to see how it works.

                                (jetty/run-jetty {:port port :join? false})])

run-jetty DOES have to have something thrown at it...your router...I believe. 
* TODO ^ it works now, come back and explain how to stack integrant components

Admin should have a hub of some sort to make posts.  Initially I'll be the only poster then allow comments as I get some grounding. Maybe within a year or so I can open up for users... or maybe it will be my own ranting corner
